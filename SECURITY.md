## Supported Versions

We are a small team and will do our best to provide patches for supported versions of our project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please contact us directly at either [alexy.grabov@gmail.com](mailto:alexy.grabov@gmail.com) or [ytupman@gmail.com](mailto:ytupman@gmail.com). Do not file a public issue as this makes the vulnerability immediately visible to everyone.

To help us understand the issue, please include as much of the following information as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
- Potential mitigations or workarounds

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and will work with you to understand the severity and impact of the issue. Once we have a fix, we will coordinate the release of the fix and will credit you for your discovery if you wish.

## Security Best Practices

Even though our team is small, we adhere to the following best practices to ensure the security of our project and its users:

- Regularly update dependencies and monitor for known vulnerabilities.
- Use secure coding practices and review code for potential security issues.
- Educate ourselves on security best practices.
