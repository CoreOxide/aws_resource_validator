# Best Practices

## Project Structure
- **Modular Design**: Organize your code into modules based on functionality.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensure each module has a single responsibility.

## Coding Standards
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code.
- **Docstrings**: Use docstrings for all public modules, classes, and functions.

## Version Control
- **Git**: Use Git for version control.
- **Branching Strategy**: Follow a branching strategy such as GitFlow or GitHub Flow.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual components.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure different parts of the application work together.
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage.

## CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- **Automated Testing**: Run automated tests on each pull request.

## Documentation
- **MkDocs**: Use MkDocs for project documentation.
- **API Reference**: Automatically generate API reference documentation.

## Security
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies.
- **Sensitive Information**: Use environment variables for sensitive information.
- **Reporting Vulnerabilities**: Have a clear process for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Deployment
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
- **Environment Configuration**: Maintain separate configurations for different environments.

## Logging and Monitoring
- **Logging**: Implement logging to capture important events and errors.
- **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring and alerts for critical components.

## Performance
- **Efficiency**: Write efficient code to optimize performance.
- **Scalability**: Design the system to scale horizontally.
